\chapter{Conclusion}
The Active Inference agent demonstrates clear advantages in environments with stable or moderately dynamic characteristics, outperforming the heuristic agent in global SLO satisfaction and stability. Its preference for equilibrium and minimal reconfiguration makes it well-suited for maintaining long-term QoE and SLO compliance. However, its performance degrades significantly in highly volatile environments with sudden shifts in demand. This identifies a critical limitation of the current implementation: lack of fast re-adaptation mechanisms. Future work should investigate strategies for incorporating online model updates to improve reactivity under such conditions.
