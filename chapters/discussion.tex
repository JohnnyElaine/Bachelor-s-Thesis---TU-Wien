\section{AIF on Worker, worker sends preferences to Producer}
AIF auch auf dem Worker. Worker misst die Qualität seines outputs(frames). 
Der Worker teilt seine preference für inference quality dem Producer mit. 
Der Producer übernimmt die joint preferences von den workerm

Welches problem Löst das? Beispeil:
Worker läuft mit inference quality  5/10. Er hätte die ressourcen seine inference quality auf 6/10 zu erhöhen.
Jedoch weis er durch kombination von momentanen messergebnissen und seinen vorherigen states (encoded im generative model), dass eine erhöhun gauf 6/10 infernce quality die qualität des outputs nicht verbessert und nur ressourcen verschwenden würde.

\section{very slow worker nodes}
The load balancing design pattern maximizes the resource usage in heterogeneous workers. But it doesnt resolve the issue of extremely slow worker nodes. When a worker is below a certain threshold for processing a single \textbf{task}, then this tasks may not be used in the resulting output. This is because by the time the slow worker is done processing its tasks, the output-stream has already moved past this point. Meaning that the work done by the node is essential useless.

For example:
If we have video-stream running at 30fps, this means that there has to be a new frame every \(33\text{ms}\). If the delay between the source-stream and the output-stream is \(1\text{s}\), then a worker has at most \(1\text{s}\) for processing a single task. If the worker is unable to processes the requested task within this time frame, then the result-task will discarded by the collector as it is ''behind'' the current stream, i.e., the most recent task that has reached output has a higher id then the task that was submitted by the slow worker node. This results in lost information, e.g, dropped frames for a video stream and the computational power of the slow worker node is wasted.

To combat this, we implemented the SLO \textit{Average Task Processing Time per worker}, meaning if a single worker is too slow, then the stream parameter configuration is changed. This comes with the downside that when a single worker is way slower than the other workers, it might drag down the QoE of the entire system.
