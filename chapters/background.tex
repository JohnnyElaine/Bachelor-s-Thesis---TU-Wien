\chapter{Background}
This chapter introduces foundational concepts essential for understanding how Active Inference
can be effectively leveraged to uphold Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in resource-constrained
edge computing environments. The first section establishes the critical role of SLOs in edge computing scenarios. The subsequent section explores all of the key concepts regarding Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle. The final section discusses the application of Active Inference in distributed systems.
